1 Install lshw on PVE
apt install lshw

2 Check & note down details about physical disks we want to passthrough
lshw -class disk -class storage

We should use disk by their ID rather than name (/dev/sda) which can change and will cause trouble

2.1 Use following command to list all physical disk IDs
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/

2.2 Now we need to find the one that matches the “product” or “serial”
e.g...... /dev/disk/by-id/ata-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx_xxx ......
or try
ls -al /dev/disk/by-id | grep SHdi1uhJ
or
ls -al /dev/disk/by-id | grep SJFhf7219


3 Add the disk to VM
qm set 100 -scsi5 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx_xxx

100: The VM id which can be found from PVE web gui (besides the VM’s name)
scsi5: The virtual port number which the disk will be using to attach to VM
For example, in the following configuration, the disk is attached by using -scsi0, if we want to attach another disk, we can use -scsi1 or -scsi2 or -scsi3 etc…..

4 Check if the disk attached successfully
cat /etc/pve/qemu-server/100.conf | grep SHdi1uhJ 

Output should look like this:
scsi5: /dev/disk/by-id/ata-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx_xxx, size=......

Note
There are different Controller Types we can use, IDE (Slow), SCSI (Fast), VirtIO Block (May get deprecated in the future)
Using SCSI with VirtIO SCSI as SCSI Controller Type for VM disks is recommended

5 Bonus
5.1 How to passthrough HDD serial number to VM
To passthrough HDD or SSD serial number, we can find the HDD serial number, manually edit the VM conf file and add the HDD serial number there.
Before start, make sure the relative VM is powered off.

5.2 To find HDD/SSH serial number by using lshw -C disk

nano /etc/pve/qemu-server/100.conf
Find the line like following

virtio1: /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx,size=xxxxxxK
We add the serial number to the end of the line, the final line looks like

virtio1: /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx,size=xxxxxxK,serial=xxxxxx-xxxxxxx
Note: The limit for serial is 18-20bytes (around 18 characters), no space allowed

Ctrl + X, Y, Enter key to Save and Exit the nano text editor
