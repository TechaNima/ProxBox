lsblk #Lists all block devices
fdisk -l #Lists all disks and some basic info
lsblk -o +FSTYPE,UUID  /dev/sdd* #This finds the filesystem type and UUID of the disk you want to permanently mount. Replace sdd with your disk!

mkdir /mnt/pve/(Your Mount Point Name)
Once you have your mount path and disk UUID modify this accordingly:
echo 'UUID=8aca782f-8e21-47d3-a247-8812c6a79968 /mnt/pve/Samsung_840_Evo_1TB    ext4    defaults 0   2' >> /etc/fstab
